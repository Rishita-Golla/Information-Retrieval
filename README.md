# Information-Retrieval


In this project, we developed an entity-based framework for searching bibliographic data from complex natural language queries.
The implementation consists of coming up with a set of algorithms using dependency and graph relations to convert input query to graph language
query - Cypher and retrieve records from graph database Neo4j.
